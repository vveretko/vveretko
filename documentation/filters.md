# Filters

## Overview

Filters allow you to refine your device list based on specific parameters. You can add filters using the search bar or the **Add Filter** button. Filters can be applied to various attributes, enabling precise and dynamic segmentation. By combining and customizing filters, you can create complex queries for more specific device management.

## Types of Filters

### Available Device Filter Types

You can filter devices by the following parameters:
- **Device Activated By** – Filter by the email of the person who activated the device.
- **Device Activated** – Filter by the date of device activation.
- **Device Owner Name** – Filter by the name of the device owner.
- **Device Owner Email** – Filter by the email of the device owner.
- **Device Status** – Filter by the current status of the device.
- **Device Last Reported** – Filter by the date when the device last sent data.
- **Device Name** – Filter by the name of the device.
- **Metadata** – Filter by custom metadata fields.
- **Organization Name** – Filter by the organization the device is associated with.
- **Tag** – Filter by assigned tags.
- **Template Name** – Filter by the template used by the device.
- **Location** – Filter by location data such as address, ZIP code, city, or country.
- **Contact** – Filter by contact metadata.

### Filtering Conditions

Each filter type supports various filtering conditions depending on the parameter:

- **Number-based Filters**:
  - Is equal to
  - Is not equal to
  - Is empty

- **Text-based Filters**:
  - Contains
  - Does not contain

- **Date-based Filters**:
  - Less than
  - More than

### Multiple Values and Bulk Filtering Conditions

- You can apply multiple values to a single filter, which will act as an "OR" condition.
- When adding multiple filters, you can define the bulk filtering condition. There are two options:
  - **Match All** (AND condition): Entities must satisfy all filter criteria.
  - **Match Any** (OR condition): Entities must satisfy any of the filter criteria.

## How to Add and Apply Filters

### Applying Filter Logic

**Single Filter:**
- When applying a single filter, the filtering is based on the selected parameter and value.

**Multiple Filters:**
1. Add the first filter and set the desired criteria.
2. Add additional filters as needed.
3. Select the bulk condition:
   - **Match All**: The device must satisfy all the filter criteria.
   - **Match Any**: The device must satisfy any of the filter criteria.


## Examples

### Example 1: Filtering by Device Name
1. Add a filter for **Device Name**.
2. Select `Contains` as the filtering condition.
3. Enter the value "Sensor".

This will display devices whose names contain "Sensor."

### Example 2: Combining Filters
1. Add a filter for **Location (City)** and set it to `Contains` "New York".
2. Add a filter for **Device Status** and set it to `Contains` "Online".
3. Set the bulk filtering condition to **Match All**.

This will display online devices located in New York.

### Example 3: Single Filter with Multiple Values
1. Add a filter for **Device Tag**.
2. Select `Contains` as the filtering condition.
3. Enter the values "Error" and "Problem".

This will display devices with tags that contain either "Error" or "Problem."


## Limitations

- You can add a maximum of 5 filters.
- A single filter can contain a maximum of 10 values.
